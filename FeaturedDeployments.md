The software package consists in two applications, the client runs on Android phones and the server side runs on a web server with PHP and MySQL. The client works as a data gathering application (using ODK), a training device (Using videos and quizzes to test understanding of content) and a medical consult tool (using the voice calling capabilities and the camera on the phone to send pictures to the doctor on call), the server side shows the collected information and provides statistics.

A messaging system embedded in the client provides encrypted two way messaging between the Medical staff and the community health workers.

### [Johns Hopkins University Global Water Program](http://globalwater.jhu.edu) (Ghana) ###
The JHU GWP focuses on solving the global water challenge of providing safe, sufficient water through innovation, education, and collaboration. Since 2008, the JHU Global Water Program (GWP) and Center for Water and Health (CWH) have managed a longitudinal study to understand the health impacts, changes in hygiene practices, and determinants of use related to water treatment and vending kiosks in four rural communities in Ghana. Each year, surveyors collect data from over 500 households in four languages.  These in-depth surveys can take over an hour, and the logic involved has been quite complex—forcing surveyors to flip back and forth between pages, parse and interpret survey directions while simultaneously maintaining the flow of the interview. In order to improve data quality and streamline the survey process, the team at the Center for Water and Health decided to pilot the use of mobile devices/cell phones for data collection. In their own words, "Our decision to use ODK has proven successful in surprising ways.". Read their [report](http://globalwater.jhu.edu/magazine/article/androids_come_to_ghana/) and [field notes](http://groups.google.com/group/opendatakit/browse_thread/thread/482acd1de955692e).
