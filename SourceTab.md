<font color='red'>MIGRATION TO GITHUB IS IN PROGRESS</font>

Please update your link!

Our developer documentation has moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/opendatakit/opendatakit/wiki).

All projects have been migrated to https://github.com/opendatakit

However, it has come to our attention that the changeset history was somewhat corrupted during the migration. We are evaluating our options and may rebase the GitHub projects to restore changeset history.

Each project's README.md includes the support status for that project.
